I was a bit confused by the tutorial. I followed the steps to complete it (and used it as a refresher for TS because I've touched it before),
but it didn't actually involve setting up TS. I copied the tutorial files in along with the minimal code I had to write in Codelab.ts, but I 
don't think its immediately runnable.
